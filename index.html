        <h1>WHAT IS OS?</h1>
           <h3>
        An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. 
        It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and 
        hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to 
        speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
           </h3>
           <p>
            <p1><b>An operating system (OS)</b></p1> <br> is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around<b> 82.74%</b>. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place <b>13.23%</b>, and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place <b>1.57%</b>. In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to <b>70%</b> in the year 2017. According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with <b>87.5%</b> with also a growth rate of <b>10.3%</b> per year, followed by Apple's iOS with <b>12.1%</b> with per year decrease in market share of <b>5.2%</b>, while other operating systems amount to just <b>0.3%</b>. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.</p>
